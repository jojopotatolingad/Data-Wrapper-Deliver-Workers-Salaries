	<p class="body-text">By the end of the year, the country's eCommerce market will almost reach $1 trillion in revenue, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but not everyone will reap this gain.</p>

	<p class="body-text">The industry’s profits skyrocketed due to the pandemic. Online companies like Amazon and Walmart have seen their annual profits change to double-digit percent change. In contrast, delivery drivers have seen their salaries increase by single-digit percent change, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor (BLS).</p>

	<p class="body-text">Delivery workers have increased their median annual salary by 7.4% to $45,695 in 2021, according to BLS. One reason many delivery drivers don’t have negotiating power for better wages or working condition is because they are considered sub-contractors, and not employees, for example, of Amazon, says Daisy Chung, a labor and employment lawyer. </p>

	<p class="body-text">Since these delivery drivers are not employees of the companies, they are “totally absolve of labor violation and accidents that occur,” Chung explains. Chung says these independent companies that hire these drivers have a ‘take it or leave it’ stance in terms of what they are willing to offer in pay compensation. </p>
